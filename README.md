Horror game I'm making inspired by "It Steals"

I'm taking inspiration from "It Steals" by Zeekerss. The game will take place in a maze in which you are trapped with some evil entity. The entity will hunt you down while you attempt to escape/complete some task.

Parts of the maze will be indoors with a checkerboard pattern like in "It Steals", but a major part of the game will be the corn maze (hence the name "Maize"). The monster will be a giant corn on the cob.
